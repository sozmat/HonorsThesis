        Based on a set of letters, sum their frequency score at each position.
        e.g. If we have 1,000 possible 5 letter words, and we look at the word

        S gets a score of 300.

        Applying this logic to all letters in the word provides a frequency score,

          guess (word with the highest frequency score)
        - Checking which letters, if any, in the guess match the target_word correctly (in the same positions)
        - Checking whether any of the remaining letters in the guess appear in the target word (misplaced letters),
          otherwise tagging them as incorrect

        - If the list contains all 2's (correct guess), breaking the loop
